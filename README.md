# Construction Design
Freelance website made with vanilla Javascript, SCSS, and semantic HTML. The sole purpose of this demo is to show off my web development and web design skills. Initially designed using Figma, and upon approval, coding it from scratch with zero frameworks. Will also be highly optimized for performance, accessibility, etc. Link to demo coming soon.
