# Construction Design
Freelance website made with vanilla Javascript, SCSS, and semantic HTML to show off my skills. Initially designed using Figma, and upon approval, coding it from scratch with zero frameworks. Will also be highly optimized for performance, accessibility, etc. Link to demo coming soon.
